Thank you for purchasing the Low Poly MOBA Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
A demoscene with a large map is also included.

I recommend you to use the Post Processing Stack for better results, which is available for free on Unity.

 

If you like the pack we would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!
